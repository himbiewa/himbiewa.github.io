<h2>kaboom pigs origin by himbiewa</h2>
<p> Before kaboom pig was kaboom pig, Kaboom pig was a normal pig just like any other pig until one day, his farm that he lived on went KABOOM! nobody knows how...<br/>
He went flying in to the clouds, which some how formed wings on his back. he then flew down to the ground where the lord of kaboom gave him the gift of kaboom. then the pig fell asleep.<br/>
When he woke up an evil farmer was trying to eat him, so he flew away and built a house. Now, for some reason, whenever kaboom pig hears Kaboom!, he flies off toward it.</p>
